A library of historic cryptographic algorithms implemented in rust.

## Usage

To use this crypt of ciphers, add the following to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
cipher-crypt = "^0.5"
```
Using the crate as such:

```rust
extern crate cipher_crypt;
use cipher_crypt::ROT13;

fn main(){
  let m = "I am my own inverse";
  assert_eq!(m, ROT13::apply(&ROT13::apply(m)));
}
```

## Ciphers

The crypt only contains a few ciphers, but with time (and your help) it will have even more! A list of what is planned for the future and what is currently implemented is as follows.

- [x] ROT13
- [x] Caesar
- [ ] Affine
- [x] Rail-fence
- [ ] Baconian
- [ ] Polybius Square
- [ ] Columnar Transposition
- [x] Autokey
- [ ] Porta
- [x] Vigen√®re
- [ ] Homophonic
- [ ] Four-Square
- [x] Hill
- [ ] Playfair
- [ ] ADFGVX
- [ ] Bifid
- [ ] Straddle Checkerboard
- [ ] Trifid
- [ ] Fractionated Morse

## Contributions

Contributions are extremely welcome. A good place to start would be helping to implement new algorithms. General cleanup and improvements of the code would also be greatly appreciated.

## Disclaimer

There's a reason these archaic methods are no longer used - its because they are extremely easy to crack!
Intended for learning purposes only, these ciphers should not be used to encrypt data of any real value.
