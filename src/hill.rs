//! In classical cryptography, the Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on
//! linear algebra.
//!
//! Invented by Lester S. Hill in 1929, it was the first polygraphic cipher in which it was
//! practical (though barely) to operate on more than three symbols at once. The matrix used for
//! encryption is the cipher key, and it should be chosen randomly from the set of invertible n Ã—
//! n matrices (modulo 26).
//!
//! Please note that this cipher uses the external library
//! [rulinalg](https://crates.io/crates/rulinalg) to perform the linear algebra calculations. If
//! you want to create an instance of the `Hill` struct using the `new` function, then you will
//! need to add a dependency on the `rulinalg` crate in `Cargo.toml`. Alternatively, you could
//! avoid dealing with matrices altogether by creating an instance of `Hill` via the function
//! `Hill::from_phrase(...)`.

            The basic process is to break a message up into chunks (a set of character vectors),
            whose individual length is equal to the length of the square matrix key.

            Once we have obtained these chunks, we transform them so that the character is replaced
            with its index within the alphabet. For example:
            ['A', 'T', 'T'] = [0, 19, 19]

            Once we have this list of indices, we perform a matrix multiplication of this
            vector/matrix with the key matrix. For example say we had a key `k` ...

                k * [0, 19, 19] mod 26 = [15, 5, 14] -> ['P', 'F', 'O'] encrypted characters

                where k = [2, 4, 5; 9, 2, 1; 3, 17, 7]

            This is repeated until all the 'chunks' of the message have been consumed/transformed.
